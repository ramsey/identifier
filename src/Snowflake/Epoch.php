     * > 1st, 2011. There have been 1387263000 milliseconds since the beginning of our epochâ€¦

     * If the current date is September 9th, 2011, at 5:00pm, and there have been 1,387,263,000 milliseconds since the
     * beginning of the epoch, then the epoch must have begun on August 24, 2011. Later in the same post, they use some
     * PL/PGSQL code to illustrate the calculation. In it, the epoch is written as `1314220021721`, which is on August
     * 24, 2011, if this is a count of milliseconds since the Unix epoch. This is the value we use, since it appears to
     * align with all their examples.
